Hi!
I am Halil, a software engineer from Poland.

Programming is a hobby from my early childhood days. I have been doing it for more than 10 years professionally. I happened to live in few different countries as an expat software engineer (Estonia, UK, Turkey, and currently Poland)

I am a bit obsessed with good quality software. Good enough is not good enough for me.  Starting from the ideation, to giving feedback in ux design, designing an architecture that scales, implementing the mvp, creating devops pipelines, gathering feedback from end-users.. repeat until it becomes perfect. I love being involced in every phase of it one way or another.

I believe in a strong team culture. I like it when everyone in my team is empowered by each other and takes the lead in their area of expertise. I aim to be that force-multiplier kind of person and try my best to give everyone that juice to share some part of the responsibility. I see developing world-class software as a team-sport after all.

My kindle mostly consists of articles I find interesting on the web (mostly hackernews) and books about my profession. Playing electric guitar on a Vox without disturbing anyone at night is also something I like to do occassionally.

Apart from my day job, there is almost always a project on the side I keep myself busy with in the evenings or at some weekends if I can negotiate the time with my SO. I am a father of 2 beatiful girls and I love them endlessly.
