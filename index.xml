      <description>Hi! I am Halil.
🇵🇱 A software engineer based in Poland.
👨🏼‍💻 Currently Senior Software Engineer at Avantida
Programming is a hobby from my early childhood days. I have been doing it for more than 10 years professionally. I happened to live in few different countries as an expat software engineer (Estonia, UK, Turkey, and currently Poland)
🎯 I am a bit obsessed with good quality software. Good enough is usually not good enough for me.</description>
